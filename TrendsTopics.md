###  a method of pre-training language representations
* Context-free models
  - word2vec or GloVe generate a single "word embedding" 
* pre-training contextual representations
  - BERT / Semi-supervised Sequence Learning, Generative Pre-Training, ELMo, and ULMFit
* ELMo
* BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers)
  - a new method of pre-training language representations
  - git: https://github.com/google-research/bert
